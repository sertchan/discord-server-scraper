  -  You can scrape profile pictures on 'webp' | 'png' | 'jpg' | 'jpeg' formats.
  -  You can reach usernames of all users from txt.
  -  You could use id's from json database.
  -  Bot creates specific folders for guilds so it is really easy to handle.
  -  I used local json database for safety and accessibility.
  -  It is not possiable to rewrite this project with using discord res api due restrictions.
