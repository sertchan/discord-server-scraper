⚠️ This project uses discord.js selfbot api so the risks you take are your own.

🎌 The goal of the project is scraping users in specifed guild. Scrapes pfp's, usernames, ids, pfp url's. 

💗 I'm already so so much appreciated who gives star the project or supports me on buy me a coffe! 

# 👾 Features
  -  You can scrape profile pictures on 'webp' | 'png' | 'jpg' | 'jpeg' formats.
  -  You can reach usernames of all users from txt.
  -  You could use id's from json database.
  -  Bot creates specific folders for guilds so it is really easy to handle.
  -  I used local json database for safety and accessibility.
  -  It is not possiable to rewrite this project with using discord res api due restrictions. 

# 💌 Notes
  - 😶‍🌫️ I added all of thing could scaraped as an normal user on api. Scraping banners. Bio's etc. as a normal user does not allowed in discord.js api. Thanks for patience.

  - 👍🏻 There are plenty of things that could be added to the script, feel free to contribute!
